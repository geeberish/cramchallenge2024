Information System Cyber Vulnerabilities Lists

Tables list the vulnerabilities that are present on the company information system under evaluation. For the purpose of this evaluation, assume that all computer Ports, Protocols, and Services (PPS) needed to exploit each listed vulnerability are enabled on the endpoint and network devices. The Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) numbers provided in the table are reference numbers for a given vulnerability used on the MITRE CVE website. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a National Vulnerability Database (NVD) that includes the CVEs, and they assign a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score to each vulnerability to recommend a severity rating if the vulnerability were successfully exploited. The NVD also provides a CVSS Calculator to allow cybersecurity engineers to adjust the default NVD CVSS score for a given vulnerability if it is deemed appropriate. Some of the NVD CVSS scores use the Version 2 calculator while others use the Version 3.x calculator, so when both CVSS scores are provide for a given vulnerability the Version 3.x calculator value should be used for this evaluation.
