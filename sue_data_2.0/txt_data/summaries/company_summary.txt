A small business company named "Working Software as a Service" (WSAAS) that develops, delivers, maintains software deployments for their customers. WSAAS customers are extremely satisfied with the products, and they have become key components within the critical missions for these customer organizations. This requires WSAAS to maintain certain critical functions for internal operations at all times in order to meet the customer's needs. The WSAAS facility layout consists of discrete spaces for the work areas: Software Development, Quality Assurance, Information Technology and Cybersecurity, and Company Management. The facility also has a Main Lobby area for visitors and during normal business hours there is a Security Guard to control visitor access to the facility. There may be some problems with the facility layout that could impact the company's cyber resiliency in the event of an outsider threat or insider threat event. Competitor companies and foreign governments very much want access to WSAAS's products design artifacts and test data as well as the unique Intellectual Property (IP) information that the company has created.
