Information from APTs should be included as examples of commonly known TTPs. All runs should 
include at a minimum TTPs from known groups. If specific APTs are known, or suspected, to be 
targeting the system under evaluation, the TTPs should be considered more strongly, and the 
defensive measures that would be likely to prevent these APTs from gaining access should be scored 
more heavily both in terms of points for or against the algorithm. The suspected APTs that should 
be considered are: NONE.
