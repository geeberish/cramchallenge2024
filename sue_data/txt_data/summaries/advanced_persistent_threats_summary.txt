Participants can choose to include any desired information on APTs that is publicly available. 
MITRE hosts a list of APTs at Groups | MITRE ATT&CKÂ® and details known tactics, techniques, and 
procedures (TTPs). An example list of possibly applicable APTs is provided below, but the list of 
possibly applicable APTs is not exhaustive. The APTs selected do not represent specific areas of 
concern, and no specific interest in the SUE is expected. However, information from these APTs 
should be included as examples of commonly known TTPs. As such, the initial demonstration run 
should include at a minimum TTPs from these groups. The initial demonstration run may also include 
adding or removing an APT and their TTPs.
