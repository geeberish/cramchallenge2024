Some additional company facility and information system characteristics to consider are:

  a. The IT staff has a mix of training and experience. Some IT staff have received IT and 
    cybersecurity certifications in the past but they have since expired. Other staff have had some 
    IT training but limited on-the-job experience and they have had no cybersecurity training. One 
    IT staff member has years of IT and cybersecurity experience, has formal technical education, 
    and has a number of IT and cybersecurity certifications. This single staff member seems to be 
    doing the vast majority of the work and they are overworked. They were hired into the company 
    within the past 6 months to improve the information system security, but the system 
    architecture is already deployed and there is no funding to make improvements until next year.
