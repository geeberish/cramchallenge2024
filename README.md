## Overview  

This tool evaluates a systemâ€™s architecture, including:  

- Defined functions  
- Required hardware and software  
- Known cyber vulnerabilities in hardware and software components  
- Effectiveness of defensive cyber capabilities during an attack by one or more Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)  

The cyber resiliency assessment algorithms will calculate:  

- The impact of a cyberspace attack scenario by a given APT(s)  
- Whether critical functions are likely to remain operational during the attack  

Additionally, the challenge includes developing **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)** to display the cyber resiliency assessment results.  

## AI-Assisted APT Scoring  

We integrated **Llama 3.1** to enhance the assessment process by providing:  

- **APT scoring**, evaluating the threat level of different adversaries  
- **Physical security scores**, analyzing vulnerabilities in hardware and infrastructure  
- **Personnel security scores**, assessing risks related to human factors and insider threats  
- **Policy scores**, measuring the effectiveness of existing cybersecurity policies and compliance  

By leveraging **Llama 3.1**, we improve threat modeling accuracy and generate dynamic risk assessments to enhance cyber resiliency planning.
